HackCU III Hackathon hosted at University of Colorado Boulder

This Location Based Chating application helps the user to set a radius(in kilometers) and broadcast messages and chat with the people in the specific radius. As soon as the user moves out of the radius, he/she cannot recieve or post messages to the previous group of people.

Imagine this app to be like walkie-talkie but with the some added features.
